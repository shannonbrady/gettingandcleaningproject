# gettingandcleaningproject
This README explains the basic functions of the script and what is included in the gettingandcleaningproject Repo.

Included is the Codebook which describes all variables in more detail

This script takes information from the Samsung Smartphone data and reports a tidy data set to describe the data.

The script reads all files in from the working directory. It then adds subject and activity data to test and train datasets.
Next, it combines test data and train data.

Each column that describes any mean or standard deviation measurement is included and descriptive labels are added.

Next, the script describes each activity based on the code given in the Samsung zip file.

Finally, the mean for each variable (mean of the means and mean of the standard deviations) is computed for each subject and each activity that subject was performing.
