The variables are labeled based on the naming scheme in the raw data folder.

Here is a description from left to right:

  First variables are all raw data:
Body acceleration in x, y, and z directions (mean and std)
Gravity acceleration in x, y, and z directions (mean and std)
Body acceleration jerk in x, y, and z directions (mean and std)
Body gyro in x, y, and z directions (mean and std)
Body gyro jerk in x, y, and z directions (mean and std)
Magnitude of body acceleration (mean and std)
Magnitude of gravity acceleration (mean and std)
Magnitude of body acceleration jerk (mean and std)
Magnitude of body gyro (mean and std)
Magnitude of body gyro jerk (mean and std)

  The next variables are all Fourier-Transfered:
Body acceleration in x, y, and z directions (mean and std)
Body acceleration jerk in x, y, and z directions (mean and std)
Body gyro in x, y, and z directions (mean and std)
Magnitude of body acceleration (mean and std)
Magnitude of body body acceleration jerk (mean and std)
Magnitude of body body gyro (mean and std)
Magnitude of body body gyro jerk (mean and std)
